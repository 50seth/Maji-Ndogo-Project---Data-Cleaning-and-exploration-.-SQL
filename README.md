Project Overview

Access to clean and reliable water remains a crucial issue, especially in underserved communities. This project aims to:

Clean and transform raw water services data.

Explore patterns and insights in water usage, service coverage, and efficiency.

Support data-driven decision-making for improved water access and management.

Data Sources

The datasets used include:

Water iServices Dataset: Information on water distribution, service requests, and resolution times.

Maji Ndogo Dataset: Data on small-scale water vendors, pricing, and supply challenges.

SQL Techniques Used

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing and null values.

Standardizing inconsistent data formats.

Removing duplicates and irrelevant records.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Aggregations to understand service performance.

Joins and subqueries for comprehensive analysis.

Creating views for simplified reporting.

Optimization:

Indexing and query optimization for faster performance.

Key Insights

Identified gaps in service delivery and response times.

Highlighted disparities in water pricing among different regions.

Open and review the SQL scripts in the sql/ directory.

Connect to your SQL environment and execute the scripts.

Future Improvements

Integrate visualizations using Power BI or Tableau.

Automate data pipelines for real-time updates.

Expand the analysis with external datasets for broader context.
